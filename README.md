# nwt_sennet_analysis_public

This repository contains the analyses for my masters research. I studied how the greenup of alpine plants differs across years and space due to abiotic and biotic factors.

This repository is a public version of my nwt_sennet_analysis repository. Proprietary data has been sampled to 10% of observations.
